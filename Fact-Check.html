	<h2>Myth vs. Fact</h2>

			<tr>
				<th>Myth</th>
				<th>Fact</th>

			<tr>
				<td>Mental health problems don't affect me.</td>
				<td>Mental health problems affect everyone. <br>
				Mental health problems are very common.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Only adults experience mental health problems.</td>
				<td>Half of all mental health disorders show first signs before a person turns 14 years old, and three-quarters of mental health disorders begin before age 24.<sup>[1]</sup></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Mental illness makes people violent.</td>
				<td>The vast majority of people with mental health problems are no more likely to be violent than anyone else. Most people with mental illness are not violent and only 3%â€“5% of violent acts can be attributed to individuals living with a serious mental illness. In fact, people with severe mental illnesses are over 10 times more likely to be victims of violent crime than the general population. <sup>[1]</sup></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>There is no hope for people with mental illness.</td>
				<td>Studies show that people with mental health problems get better and many recover completely. Recovery refers to the process in which people are able to live, work, learn, and participate fully in their communities. There are more treatments, services, and community support systems than ever before, and they work.<sup>[1]</sup></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>It's impossible to prevent mental illness.</td>
				<td>Prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders focuses on addressing known risk factors such as exposure to trauma that can affect the chances that children, youth, and young adults will develop mental health problems.<sup>[1]</sup></td>
